## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [support@typicalbot.com](mailto:support@typicalbot.com).

## Making Contributions

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, [please include as many details as possible](#submitting-a-bug-report). Please fill out the template completely, since doing so helps contributors resolve issues faster.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

- Search [previous issues](https://github.com/search?q=+is%3Aissue+user%3Atypicalbot) to see if the problem you are experiencing has already been reported. If it has and the issue is still open, comment on that issue instead of opening a new one.
- Try reproducing the problem on the latest commit in the [master](https://github.com/typicalbot/typicalbot/tree/master) branch.

#### Submitting A Bug Report

When submitting a bug report issue, keep these guidelines in mind so that the problem can be resolved as swifly as possible.

- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
- Describe the exact steps that reproduce the problem in as many details as possible. When listing steps, explain how you did each step.
- Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out exactly what the problem is with that behavior. Explain what behavior you expected.
- Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps.
- If possible, include screenshots and animated GIFs which demonstrate the problem.

### Suggesting Enhancements and Features

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-suggestion) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, [please include as many details as possible](#submitting-an-enhancement-suggestion).

#### Before Submitting A Suggestion

- Check to see if the enhancement or feature you're thinking of has already been completed for an upcoming release.
- Search [previous suggestions](https://github.com/search?q=+is%3Aissue+user%3Atypicalbot) to see if your enhancement or feature has already been suggested. If it has and the issue is still open, comment on that issue instead of opening a new one.

#### Submitting A Suggestion

- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the enhancement or feature you are suggesting.
- Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement or feature in as many details as possible.
- Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps.
- Explain why this enhancement would be useful to most TypicalBot users.

### Pull Requests

In order to have your pull request considered for review, it must meet the following requirements:

- A completed [pull request template](https://github.com/typicalbot/typicalbot/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md). If the pull request template is not completed, you'll be asked to complete it before your pull request will be considered for merging.
- Compliance with the [style guides](#style-guides). If your pull request doesn't comply with one or more of the style guides, you'll be asked to bring it to complaince before your pull request will be considered for merging.
- Completed documentation and tests, if applicable.

> If your pull request closes an issue, state so under the Issues section in your pull request like so: `Closes #<issue>`. This helps ensure that GitHub automatically closes the issue when your pull request is merged.

> The reviewer(s) of your pull request may request changes or ask you to complete additional tasks, tests, or other changes before your pull request will be accepted and merged.

## Style Guides

### CHANGELOG

Use [Keepachangelog.org](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) as a guide for adding changes to the CHANGELOG.

Each item should be in the following format: `<package>: <change> (#<pr>) (<commit>)[, closes #<issue>]`.

- Replace `<package>` with the name of the package the change applies to.
- Replace `<change>` with a description of the change (usually the commit name will suffice).
- Replace `<pr>` with the pull request number where the change was proposed.
- Replace `<commit>` with the hash of the commit where the change was made.
- Replace `<issue>` with the issue that the change closes, if applicable.

### Git Commit Messages

- Follow [Conventional Commits v1.0.0-beta.4](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/). Allowed commit types are: `chore:`, `ci:`, `docs:`, `enhancement:`, `feat:` `fix:`, `pref:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, and `test:`. Commit types should be in lowercase. If a commit fits into multiple commit types, go back and make multiple commits whenever possible.
- Use the imperative mood (i.e. "Move command to..." not "Moves command to...").
- Use the present tense (i.e. "Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Keep commits discrete. Avoid including multiple unrelated changes in a single commit.
- Keep commits self-contained. Avoid spreading a single change across multiple commits.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

### JavaScript Style Guide

All JavaScript code must adhere to the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript), with the exception of [indents (19.1)](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript#whitespace--spaces). Use soft tabs (space character) set to 4 spaces.

### Documentation

All code must be documented using [ESDoc tags](https://esdoc.org/manual/tags.html).
